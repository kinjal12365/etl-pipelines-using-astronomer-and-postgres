Creating an ETL pipeline

I’m crafting a Python code snippet for an ETL project using Apache Airflow. It will fetch data from the NASA API, process it, and store it in a PostgreSQL database.

Creating the DAG

I’m aiming to craft an Airflow DAG in Python, incorporating the NASA API, HTTP operator for ETL, and storing results in PostgreSQL. TaskFlow will manage tasks for automation.

Navigating API details

I’m thinking through using the requests library or checking out airflow.operators.http_operator for API calls, but also considering the deprecated HttpOperator or SimpleHttpOperator in Airflow.

Integrating elements

I’m crafting an Airflow DAG in Python to fetch data from the NASA API using SimpleHttpOperator, then processing it with TaskFlow API tasks, and finally committing the results to a PostgreSQL database.

Containerization: Docker is used to containerize both the Airflow components and the PostgreSQL database.
